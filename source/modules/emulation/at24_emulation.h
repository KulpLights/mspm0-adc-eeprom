 *  @brief      Emulation library for at24-style I2C EEPROM
 *  @defgroup   AT24x I2C EEPROM Emulation Library
 *
 *  The AT24x emulation library enables MSPM0 devices to emulate a discrete
 *  EEPROM via an I2C target interface, compatible with I2C bus controllers
 *  which are expecting to use the AT24x I2C EEPROM device protocol.
 *
 *  This emulation library uses the underlying flash memory in the MSPM0 MCU
 *  as the non-volatile storage medium.  The Texas Instruments Type-B EEPROM
 *  emulation library is used to manage storing and loading data from the flash.
 *
 *  This emulation library uses the i2c_tar_driver API for implementing the
 *  I2C target I/F on the MSPM0, such that external I2C bus controllers
 *  connected via I2C to the MSPM0 may read and write the emulated EEPROM
 *  using AT24x compatible I2C commands and addressing.  This library layer
 *  is the glue logic between the I2C target driver API and the TI Type-B
 *  EEPROM emulation library.  As such it is responsible for handling the I2C
 *  commands in the same way as a discrete EERPROM IC would handle them, to the
 *  extent that this is possible with embedded flash memory in the MSPM0.
 *
 *  Known limitations:
 *      (LIMITATION-1): It is possible that >50ms may be required for some
 *      write operations to complete before new read/write commands may be
 *      accepted on the I2C I/F.  This is because of the time needed to emulate
 *      EEPROM in sectored flash memory.  Once more items have been written than
 *      the available EEPROM emulation space, re-mapping is done and a sector
 *      erase must be done.  These operations can take 10's to 100's of
 *      milliseconds depending on the cycling history of the memory and the
 *      operating temperature of the device.  I2C bus controllers issuing
 *      write commands must be aware of this limitation and must either wait
 *      this amount of time after each write transaction to emulated EEPROM,
 *      or re-try until the start is ACK'ed by this device.  Writes to
 *      emulated EEPROM only happen on a STOP condition (doing a write and
 *      issuing a RESTART will not save data to emulated EEPROM).  Once the
 *      STOP condition is issued, the commit of data to emulated EEPROM (flash)
 *      will begin.  During this time, the device will NAK any I2C START
 *      conditions which are addressed to it until the write runs to completion.

/**
 *  @brief      Open the AT24x EEPROM emulation library
 *
 *  This function opens the EEPROM emulation library.  It must be called
 *  at start-up before I2C requests from external I2C bus controllers may be
 *  handled by the device.
 *
 *  This function expects that the I2C module base address which is passed
 *  has been initialized by the application with the expected configuration
 *  settings and slave address, but that it was left disabled.
 *
 *  This function expects that the application above this layer has configured
 *  the IOMUX to enable I2C communication on the desired pins to the module
 *  whose base address was passed to this function.
 *
 *  Once this function returns, it is possible for external I2C bus controllers
 *  to start reading or writing EEPROM data within the defined address range of
 *  0 to AT24_EMU_ITEM_BYTES-1, with writes page-aligned to the
 *  AT24_EMU_PAGE_TOT_BYTES boundary (else roll-over will be observed).
 *
 *  This function may need to initialize flash memory space used for EEPROM
 *  emulation by the TI Type-B EEPROM emulation library.  As flash operations
 *  may be needed, global interrupts are disabled during flash operations to
 *  avoid issues.  The calling application must be aware of this.
 *
 *  @param[in]  pModule is a pointer to the I2C peripheral bas address.
 *
 *  @return     Zero if the library initialized correctly, else returns
 *              the EEPROM emulation library error code to the calling function.
