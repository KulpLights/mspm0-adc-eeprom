 *  @brief      I2C target mode application interface driver
 *  @defgroup   I2C Target Driver
 *
 *  The I2C target driver implements a simple application interface for I2C
 *  target communication via the to the underlying MSPM0 I2C DriverLib
 *  hardware abstraction and by extension the MSPM0 I2C peripheral in target
 *  operating mode.
 *
 *  This application interface abstracts all I2C interrupt management
 *  and I2C state management for the application.  The application
 *  only needs to provide definitions for transmit and receive callback
 *  functions (to handle I2C bus read and write commands, respectively),
 *  with those callback functions calling the simple read/write function
 *  calls provided by this library to get to and from the application.
 *
 *  This interface is designed to support multiple instances of I2C target
 *  peripherals at the same time without adding code size.  All functions
 *  provided operate with respect to a i2c_tar_driver_t data structure
 *  which indicates the corresponding peripheral, buffers, and state.
 *  More than one i2c_tar_driver_t data structure may be set up in
 *  an application with each one being linked to a unique I2C peripheral
 *  in the device itself.  Each peripheral's interrupt handler in the
 *  application must call I2CTarDriver_ISR with the corresponding
 *  i2c_tar_driver_t pointer passed so that the correct driver instance
 *  is handled.
 *
 *  This interface supports responding to two I2C target addresses, with
 *  each address mapping to its own set of transmit and receive callback
 *  functions, respectively.  If callback functions for transmit are not
 *  mapped for a given address, 0xFF is sent by default.
 *
 *  This interface uses fully interrupt driven I/O.  It does not use DMA.
